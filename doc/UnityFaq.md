# Unity FAQ

We're all new to Unity and there will be some neat lessons learned along
the way.  Here's a place to collect some of them.

## Can't click on anything in the UI
An `EventSystem` might be missing from the scene.

## Did UI work but everything's broken
Don't start the game from a Prefab, instead start from a scene.

## Project won't load (Linux)
You might have two directories with the same name but different
capitalization.  Don't do that.

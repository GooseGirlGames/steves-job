# Steve's Job

## About

You're Steve, working as a janitor at a boring mall.  After one
particularly long day of work, you cause a teeny tiny little accident
that splits reality apart.  You find yourself in an empty void mall with
strange doors across different dimensions...

Remember:  You're the janitor, and you'll have to do your job.

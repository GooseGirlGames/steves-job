# Steve's Job

## About

You're Steve, working as a janitor at a boring mall.  One day, a
freakish accident involving a Wizard, a Hot Dog, Hello Kitty and a
child's birthday party splits reality apart.  You find yourself in an
empty void mall with strange doors across different dimensions.

Remember:  You're the janitor, and you'll have to do your job.

## Controls

NPCs can be talked to with `E`.  Press `E` to advance to the next

item from your inventory.  Press `E` to confirm your selection.

Outside of dialogue you can check out your inventory by pressing `Tab`.
Highlight items with `W` `A` `S` `D` to read about them.  You can close

That's about it, have fun!
